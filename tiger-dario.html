            <p>Endemic to Myanmar where it has been recorded from small streams and tributaries close to the city of
                Myitkyina in Kachin State as well as in nearby Lake Indawgyi, the largest inland lake in Southeast
                Asia, with and all known habitats within the Irrawaddy/Ayeyarwady river system. Other collections have
                occured further south near Mandalay city, Mandalay Division and these
                populations have been shown to vary slightly in meristics compared with those from the north of the
                country (Kullander and Britz, 2002).<br><br>Type locality is ‘Nan Kywe Chaung under bridge on road
                south to Mogaung, 25°20’20″N, 97°16’57″E, Irrawaddy River drainage, Myitkyina District, Kachin
                State, Myanmar’. Lake Indawgyi and surrounding area were designated a protected zone by the
                Ministry of Ecotourism in 1999 and now form the Indawgyi Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. Kachin
                State itself is one of the world’s great biodiversity hotspots and contains many endemic species
                although large portions of the area have already been decimated due to illegal logging.</p>

            </header>
            <p>The Black Tiger Dario displays a marked preference for small, often turbid pools with dense growths of
                aquatic plants or
                submerged grasses. The type locality is a shallow (~ 1m depth during the dry season), clear
                water stream with a sand and pebble substrate which flows through both secondary forest and
                agricultural land. The water is described as having a moderate current with grassy marginal
                vegetation and a Cryptocoryne sp. growing submerse.<br><br>D. hysginon occurs sympatrically with
                Badis corycaeus and B. kyar with the three occupying different ecological niches; B. corycaeus is
                found in running water towards the margins of the stream, B. kyar in the faster flow towards the
                centre and D. hysginon only in still pools around the shoreline. A number of other fishes
                were found at this location from Acanthocobitis, Schistura, Danio and Puntius to Pillaia, Indostomus
                and Microphis species. In Lake Indawgyi it occurs alongside B. corycaeus with both species
                collected from heavily-vegetated marginal zones. The substrate of the lake is a soft, rich
                clay mixed with high levels of decomposing plant material, while aquatic vegetation and various
                kinds of algae proliferate including Vallisneria, Elodea and Spirogyra species.<br><br>According to
                Kullander and Britz (2002) D. hysginon is most abundant in marginal, marshy zones containing
                stagnant water with sympatric fishes including Parasphaerichthys ocellatus, Heteropneustes fossilis,
                Oryzias, Esomus, Channa and Anabas species; all typical inhabitants of oxygen-deprived environments.

            <p>Temperature: It is subject to seasonal temperature fluctuations in nature and is comfortable within
                the range 59 – 77°F/15 – 25°C with even greater extremes being tolerated for short periods. In many
                countries/well-insulated homes it can be therefore maintained without artificial heating
                year-round. Higher temperatures are known to stimulate spawning activity meaning a heater
                will be required if you want to breed the fish outside of spring and summer months though. Set it to
                around 20 – 24 °C for long-term care and breeding.<br><br>pH: Prefers neutral to alkaline water with
                a value between 6.5 – 7.5.<br><br>Hardness: The water in northern Myanmar is typically soft despite
                the relatively high pH so aim for somewhere within the range 18 – 90 ppm.</p>

            <p>Dario species are micropredators feeding on small aquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other
                zooplankton. In captivity they should be offered small live or frozen fare such as Artemia
                nauplii, Daphnia, grindal, micro-, and banana worm. They’re noted as
                somewhat shy, deliberate feeders (see ‘Behaviour and Compatibility’) and it’s also important to note
                that all badids develop issues with obesity and become more susceptible to disease when fed
                chironomid larvae (bloodworm) and/or Tubifex so these should be omitted from the diet.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Given its rarity the emphasis should be on captive reproduction and we strongly recommend maintaining
                it alone. It’s not a gregarious fish as such and rival males can be very aggressive towards
                one another, especially in smaller tanks. In these cases only a single pair or one male and
                several females should be purchased, but in roomier surroundings a group can coexist provided there
                is space for each male to establish a territory and plenty of broken lines of
                sight.<br><br>Thoughtful placement of caves and boundaries can help tremendously in this respect so
                don’t be tempted to cluster all available spawning sites in one area of the tank, for
                example. If you do intend to house it in a community tankmates must be chosen with
                care. It’s slow-moving with a retiring nature and will easily be intimidated or outcompeted
                for food by larger or more boisterous tankmates. Peaceful, pelagic cyprinids such as
                Microdevario, Boraras, Trigonostigma or smaller Rasbora species make good choices as do diminutive
                loaches such as some members of the genus Petruichthys.</p>

            <p>This species is very easy to sex but often only males are traded. Males are far more colourful
                and develop extended pelvic, dorsal and anal fins than females as they mature. In addition
                females are smaller and possess a noticeably shorter, stumpier-looking body profile then males.</p>

            </header>
            <p>The Black Tiger is a substrate-spawner forming temporary pair bonds. Other fishes are best omitted if you
                want to
                raise good numbers of fry, although in a mature, well-furnished community a few may survive to
                adulthood. Either a single pair or a group of adults can be used but if using multiple males
                be sure to provide each with space to form a territory with around 30 cm² per individual
                adequate. One male will usually become dominant meaning the others will not be involved in
                breeding.<br><br>Water parameters should be within the values suggested above and the fish
                conditioned with plenty of live and frozen foods. As they come into breeding condition males
                will begin to form territories and display courtship behaviour alongside an intensified colour
                pattern. This can be prolonged for several days with the female often being chased away then
                courted again minutes later. The male will make a non-aggressive approach towards the female
                and appear to ‘invite’ her into the centre of his territory, and if ready to spawn she will
                follow. The act itself is over in just a few seconds with eggs being scattered in a random
                fashion on the underside of a solid surface such as a plant leaf.<br><br>Post-spawning the female is
                ejected and the male takes sole responsibility for the territory. If you want to maximize the
                numbers of fry raised now is the time to either remove the medium to a container containing water
                from the spawning tank or the adults as the fry will be preyed upon once hatched. The
                incubation period should be 2-3 days after which the fry may need up to a week to fully absorb the
                yolk sac. They are very small indeed and will require an infusoria-type diet until large
                enough to accept microworm, Artemia nauplii, and suchlike.</p>

            <p>This species is traded under various names such as ‘red melon Dario‘ or ‘flame red
                Dario‘. Among congeners D. dayingensis is most similar since it differs only in a few
                meristic counts and by its slightly larger adult size. D. hysginon can be told apart by
                possession of 22-24, usually 23, lateral scales (vs. 24-25 in D. dayingensis), 8½ (vs. 9½) scales in
                the transverse scale row, and absence (vs. presence) of palatine teeth in the upper jaw. A
                beautiful, striped colour form which aquarists have referred to as Dario sp. ‘Myanmar’, D. sp.
                ‘pyjamas’ , D. sp. ‘black tiger’ and ‘fire red tiger badis’ among other names is also available
                sporadically.<br><br>Little is known about this fish except that two male specimens were included in
                the type series of D. hysginon and collected to the north of Myitkyina in Kachin
                State. Despite the striking differences in colour pattern it’s officially recognised as a
                colour form of D. hysginon as per Kullander and Britz (2002) although D. sp. ‘Myanmar’ is now known
                to have an appreciably larger adult size (S. van der Voort, pers. comm.). Females are also
                distinguishable from those of D. hysginon, plus the two will not hybridise with each other in
                aquaria, so we’ve included them separately for the time being.<br><br>Dario currently contains five
                species, of which four are considered miniature species since they do not exceed 26 mm in standard
                length (SL). The fifth, D. urops, not only grows larger, to at least 28.0 mm SL, but occurs
                in southwestern India whereas the others are native to the Brahmaputra, Meghna, and Ayeyarwaddy
                river systems in northern India, Myanmar, and southwestern China, and this raises interesting
                questions regarding their biogeography. In addition, D. urops lacks some diagnostic
                characters of Dario and thus may represent the sister group to other members of the genus, though
                this hypothesis remains to be tested.<br><br>Prior to 2002 the family Badidae included just five
                species but an extensive revision paper published that year contained descriptions of ten new
                species along with the genus Dario of which the former Badis dario was designated type
                species. Dario is most easily distinguished from Badis by the small adult size of member
                species, predominantly red colouration, more extended first few dorsal rays and pectoral fins in
                males, straight-edged (vs. rounded) caudal-fin, lack of visible lateral line and less-involved
                parental behaviour.<br><br>Badids have historically been considered members of the families Nandidae
                or Pristolepididae and it was not until 1968 that Barlow proposed a separate grouping for
                them. They share some characteristics with anabantoids, nandids and channids, perhaps most
                notably the typical spawning embrace in which the male wraps his body around that of the
                female. More recent studies have concluded that this procedure is an ancient trait inherited
                from a common ancestor to all these families.<br><br>All Badis, Dario and Nandus species were found
                to share a uniquely bifurcated (split) hemal spine on the penultimate vertebra and this may provide
                evidence that the group is monophyletic (Kullander and Britz, 2002). The family Nandidae is
                currently restricted to include only Nandus species and it’s separated from Badidae by differences
                in morphology and egg structure with their phylogenetic relationships yet to be studied in detail.
